# Crimson Cleaner

Crimson Cleaner is a premium, single-player first-person horror simulation game for PC. You play as a private crime scene restorer for a criminal organization, using a set of main tools like a mop, sponge, and your own hands to clean up and complete missions. 

In the heart of New York, Mike navigates a dark underworld as a crime scene restorer for criminals on the dark web.

Despite his schizophrenia, he faces the horrors of it every night, driven by the desperate need to pay for the treatment that would save his mother's life.
